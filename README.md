# Python Flask App

Demo of a simple Flask-based Python web app - it has a few endpoints and shows public data about a Facebook page, using a local database.


## History

In 2016 after I was asked in an interview if I'd made a API before, I went home and made one for the first time.

This project is based on this tutorial:

- [Build an API in under 30 lines code](https://impythonist.wordpress.com/2015/07/12/build-an-api-under-30-lines-of-code-with-python-and-flask/)


## Features

- A Python 2.7 app built with Flask.
- It provides an API service from a SQLite3 database - this is included in version control for easy testing normally this would be excluded.
- Where a home page gives the user links to suggested endpoints
- And where queried endpoints retrieve data from SQL and return as JSON.
